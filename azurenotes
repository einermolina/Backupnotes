questions 
what is the difference between storageV1 and storageV2

vitual networt setting 

name should be unique 
address space - decide how much ip addresses are needed . they are configured CIDR Block.
azure is using 5 of your ip addresses

location is in one region but you can have it in multiple region

DDos protection (like what they do in xbox to make someone lag)
basic, standard also protects and has a learning algorithm on its dedicated server 

subnets (split the network) every network is conjoined together as default

virtual network -

-|10.0.0/23 -> #the 23 makes 512 networks# 10.0.0.-10.0.1.255
|but you can split it by having subnets each subnet made takes up 5 azure reserved addresses 
|10
|
-----subnet 1 -address space
|          10.0.0.0/24 -> 10.0.0.0-10.0.0.255 (251 =256-5)
|
----- subnet 2 AS
    10.0.1.0/24 -> 10.0.1.0-10.0.255.255 (251=256-5)
    can control flow of data  using subnets 

provate ip addresses are set up with dinamic or static ip.. Dynamic gives you a new ip evertime you access the Vm
static ip we can set a spacific ip adress (more popular used because it makes it easier to comunicate to other private IP ) 

DNS makes it available for a MV hostname to communicate to the private adress .  (hostname is easire to use instead ip address) 

Public ip -- 



application security group (ASG)
    creat application securty group 
        Eg DB server asg, Web-server ASG
    Create network securty group
    creat virtual machines  
    associate Vms networks interface to an ASG
