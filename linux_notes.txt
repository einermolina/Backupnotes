Filter/ Text processing 
cut # cuts out words $cut -c1 <filename.txt>     or $cut -c1-3 <filename.txt.> to get more letters 
awk # prints first set of words in this case names $awk '{print $1}' <seinfld_characters> to view second colom use2         instead of 1
grep # is used to fine a specific name or text $grep <molina> <file.txt>
sort # sorts text files abc order
uniq # removes duplicates (good with other commands like cat , sort,awk) $awk '{print $1}' | uniq    or                 $cat <filename> | uniq                (make sure you use sort first )
wc # word count $sort <filename>   # output: 12 21 153 <filename> 12 = lines , 21 = wors , 153 characters

They have multiply of them ubuntu mint phadora etc..
they are harder to hack
The command line does get some used to getting used to .
i just learned how to write/make a text using the vi command
from that i used the vi command to save file :wq 
also learned to move files
make/remove directorys 
make a file readable writable ~executable using chmod 
making a file root using chown(owner) chgrp (group) # making the file harder to mess with
